📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional recreation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built using Python and Tkinter GUI.
The game includes interactive gameplay, score tracking, undo functionality, timer, and persistent high-score saving.
It provides a smooth user experience and demonstrates strong concepts in OOP, event handling, file handling, and GUI design.

🚀 Key Features
✔️ 1. Classic 2048 Gameplay
Move tiles using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Tiles with the same number merge into larger values.
Random 2 or 4 tiles appear after every move.

✔️ 2. Graphical User Interface (Tkinter)
Responsive grid using Canvas.
Attractive color-coded tiles.
Real-time updates and smooth tile merging.

✔️ 3. Scoring System
The score increases every time tiles merge.
Live score displayed on screen.
Automatic high-score saving using local file storage.

✔️ 4. High Score Persistence
High score is saved in high_score.txt.
Loads automatically every time the game is opened.
Includes button to reset high score.

✔️ 5. Undo Feature
Allows the player to undo the previous move.
Stores board history and restores previous state.
Undo button automatically enables and disables based on moves.

✔️ 6. Timer Functionality
Tracks total time played for the current session.
Pauses and resumes with the game.
Updates every second.

✔️ 7. Pause & Play Controls
Pause button freezes the game, disables moves.
Play button resumes the game and timer.
Great for user control and UX improvement.

✔️ 8. Reset / Restart Game
Clears the board and starts fresh.
Resets score, timer, and game-over state.

🧠 Technical Concepts Used
🔹 Python OOP
Class-based design (Game2048 class).
Clean separation of logic: sliding tiles, merging, state saving, and UI rendering.

🔹 Tkinter GUI
Canvas for board drawing.
Buttons, labels, frames for layout.
Event binding for keyboard controls.

🔹 Game Logic
Tile sliding algorithm.
Tile merging logic.
Game-over detection.
Board state comparison and history stack.

🔹 File Handling

Saving/loading high score using a text file.

🔹 Algorithms

Random tile placement.
Move validation.
2D list manipulation.

🎯 Purpose of This Project
✔ Build complete GUI applications in Python
✔ Implement real-time interactions & event-driven programming
✔ Manage state, scoring, timer, and player actions
✔ Apply clean coding principles in OOP
✔ Add extra UI functionality beyond the original 2048 game

🏁 Conclusion

This project is a practical and engaging implementation of the 2048 game.It highlights your skills in GUI development, game logic, and Python programming.With features like Undo, High Score saving, Timer, Pause/Play controls, and Reset functionality, it becomes a polished and professional mini-game application.
